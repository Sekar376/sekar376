industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and
ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and
revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.However, they do not have an in-house

decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their
historical data.
