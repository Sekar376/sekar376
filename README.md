## Projects:
Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain  :     
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality 
industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and 
ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and 
revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.However, they do not have an in-house 
data analytics team to provide them with insights.  Their revenue management team had 
decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their 
historical data.
